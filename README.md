# About

Yoshi vs Windows: Unity Edition is a restoration project / remake of a fan-game from the site MFGG titled [Yoshi vs Windows](https://www.mfgg.net/index.php?act=resdb&param=02&c=2&id=318).

It's a childhood game of mine that I decided to modernise with modern OS compatibility.

Along with the same levels as the original game, there are loads of extras, such as a true ending, difficulties, extra levels, cheat codes, menus, files, custom Yoshi colours and extra cutscenes. The normal ending is the same ending as the original game, and the true ending is an extra ending I created.

I'd like to credit supertoad2k for creating the original Yoshi vs Windows, hpneptune for creating Yoshi Inside Windows (which really helped with asset ripping) and Shigeru Miyamoto for Yoshi itself.
